My Portfolio
Hello! üëã Welcome to my portfolio. This project is a simple showcase of my journey into full-stack web development. I'm learning and building, and this is a little corner of the internet to show what I've been working on.

About This Project
I built this portfolio to practice my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm exploring different aspects of web development, from designing the look and feel to making things interactive.

You'll find sections about:

My Skills: What I'm currently learning and working with.

About Me: A little bit about who I am and my approach to coding.

Contact: Ways to get in touch if you'd like to chat or collaborate.

I'm focusing on writing clean code, paying attention to design, and improving with every step. This is just a starting point, and I'm excited to keep learning and growing!

Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the content of the pages.

CSS: For styling and making the site look good (using Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI).


If you want to run it locally:

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/balaji-devx/prototype.git
Navigate to the project directory:


cd main
Open index.html in your browser. (You might need a live server extension if you're using VS Code for some features to work correctly.)

What's Next?
I'm continuously learning and plan to add more features and projects here as I grow my skills. Stay tuned!

I'm always open to connecting and learning from others. You can find me on:
